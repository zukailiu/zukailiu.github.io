Hi, I am Zukai Liu 刘族凯.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Prof. Jay Shendure](https://shendure-web.gs.washington.edu/) and [Dr. Nobuhiko Hamazaki](https://www.hamazaki-lab.com/) at University of Washington. My research focuses on developing innovative models and technologies to systematically understand and reconstitute the mammalian life cycle. By integrating stem-cell-based embryo models with high-throughput genomics, I aim to unravel the fundamental mechanisms driving embryogenesis, address pregnancy failures, and advance strategies to improve reproductive health.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Robson lab](https://www.google.com/search?q=roboson+lab+jackson) at The Jackson Laboratory, where I got my Ph.D. in Biomedical Science from UConn Health co-advised by [Paul Robson](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/paul-robson) and [Albert Cheng](https://cheng.bio/). My doctoral research bridged developmental biology and RNA biology. I focused on modeling human embryogenesis  during the peri-implantation stageusing human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). I developed a hiPSC-based model to study extra-embryonic mesenchymal cells (ExMC), a lineage critical to early human development but poorly characterized for decades. Using this model, I uncovered the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins, and pivotal roles in early human development. This work became integral to the [MorPhic Consortium](https://morphic.bio/), a global initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive catalog of molecular and cellular phenotypes for every human gene. The ExMC model now serves as a key platform for understanding how specific genes and pathways influence implantation biology and why human embryogenesis diverges from other mammals. Concurrently, my work in the Cheng Lab focused on RNA biology and engineering, where I developed [CREST](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad547), a novel platform that integrates RNA splicing and base editing into a single system, reducing off-target effects by 98% compared to existing tools. Together, these projects highlight my ability to address fundamental biological questions while driving technological advancements, bridging the gap between basic research and translational applications.

I hold an M.S. in Developmental Biology from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences) and a B.S. in Biotechnology from [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). My passion for intersection of developmental biology and RNA biology was sparked during my master’s research on [microRNAs](https://academic.oup.com/jmcb/article/10/4/302/5059631?) and [RNA-binding proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29309-1) in tumorigenesis. This early curiosity set the stage for my multidisciplinary approach to developmental biology and RNA engineering. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with my dog.
