I am a Postdocral Fellow working with [Jay Shendure](https://shendure-web.gs.washington.edu/) and [Nobuhiko Hamazaki](https://www.hamazaki-lab.com/) at University of Washington. My postdoctoral research focuses on developing innovative technologies and models to systematically understand and reconstitute the mammalian life cycle. By integrating stem-cell-based embryo models with high-throughput genomics, I aim to uncover the fundamental mechanisms driving mammalian embryogenesis, investigate the causes of pregnancy failure, and explore strategies to address these challenges. This interdisciplinary work at the intersection of developmental biology and genomics offers transformative insights into the origins of life and the factors that make it vulnerable.


Prior to joining UW, I got my Ph.D. in [Biomedical Science](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/) from UConn Health, where I was co-advised by by [Paul Robson](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/paul-robson) and [Albert Cheng](https://cheng.bio/). My doctoral research combined developmental biology and RNA biology. At the [Robson lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-robson-lab), I modeled human embryogenesis during the peri-implantation stage using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Specifically, I developed a hiPSC-based model to study extra-embryonic mesenchymal cells (ExMC), a unique lineage in primate embryogenesis identified over 70 years ago but poorly characterized at the molecular level. Using this model, I uncovered the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins, and developmental roles in ealy human development. 

My work contributed to the [MorPhic](https://morphic.bio/) consortium, where the Robson Lab is one of five founding groups. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive catalog of molecular and cellular phenotypes for null alleles of every human gene using in vitro multicellular systems. The hiPSC-based ExMC model I developed is one of the cornerstone systems in this effort, helping to reveal how specific genes and pathways contribute to human implantation biology and why human embryogenesis diverges from that of other mammals.

In parallel, my work in the [Cheng Lab](https://cheng.bio/) focused on advancing RNA engineering technologies. I developed [CREST](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad547), a novel platform that integrates multiple RNA engineering functions, including splicing and base editing, into a single system. CREST demonstrated a remarkable 98% reduction in off-target effects, providing a powerful tool for advancing RNA-based research and therapeutics.

Before that, I was first introduced to RNA biology during my master’s studies, where I investigated the roles of [microRNAs](https://academic.oup.com/jmcb/article/10/4/302/5059631?login=false) and [RNA binding protein](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29309-1) in tumorigenesis. This early exposure sparked my passion for understanding RNA’s regulatory roles, shaping the trajectory of my scientific career.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with my dog.
