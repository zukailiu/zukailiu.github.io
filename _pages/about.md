I am a Postdocral Fellow working with [Jay Shendure](https://shendure-web.gs.washington.edu/) and [Nobuhiko Hamazaki](https://www.hamazaki-lab.com/) at University of Washington (UW). My postdoctoral research focuses on developing innovative technologies and models to systematically understand and reconstitute the mammalian life cycle. By integrating stem-cell-based embryo models with high-throughput genomics, I aim to uncover the fundamental mechanisms driving mammalian embryogenesis, investigate the causes of pregnancy failure, and explore strategies to address these challenges. 

Prior to joining UW, I got my Ph.D. in Biomedical Science from UConn Health, where I was co-advised by by [Paul Robson](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/paul-robson) and [Albert Cheng](https://cheng.bio/). My doctoral research combined developmental biology and RNA biology. At the [Robson lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-robson-lab), I focused on modeling human embryogenesis during the peri-implantation stage using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). I developed a hiPSC-based model to study extra-embryonic mesenchymal cells (ExMC), a unique lineage in primate embryogenesis that was first identified over 70 years ago but remained poorly characterized at the molecular level. Using this model, I uncovered ExMC’s molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins, and roles in early human development. This work became a key component of the [MorPhic](https://morphic.bio/) consortium, where the Robson Lab is a founding member. MorPhic aims to create a comprehensive catalog of molecular and cellular phenotypes for null alleles of every human gene using in vitro multicellular systems. The ExMC model I developed serves as one of the consortium’s cornerstone systems, helping to elucidate how specific genes and pathways contribute to human implantation biology and why human embryogenesis diverges from other mammals. In parallel, my work in the [Cheng Lab](https://cheng.bio/) focused on RNA engineering. I developed [CREST](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad547), a novel platform that integrates RNA splicing and base editing into a single system, reducing off-target effects by 98%.This platform serves as a powerful tool for RNA-based research and therapeutics, demonstrating the potential for precise and multifunctional RNA editing technologies. Together, my contributions to both developmental biology and RNA engineering reflect my dedication to addressing fundamental biological questions and driving technological innovation.

Before that, I was first introduced to RNA biology during my master’s studies, where I investigated the roles of [microRNAs](https://academic.oup.com/jmcb/article/10/4/302/5059631?login=false) and [RNA binding protein](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29309-1) in tumorigenesis. This early exposure sparked my passion for understanding RNA’s regulatory roles, shaping the trajectory of my scientific career.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with my dog.
