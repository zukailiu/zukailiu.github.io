Professional Experience
======
* Postdoctoral fellow, University of Washington, 2024 - now
* Postdoctoral fellow, The Jackson Laboratory, 2023 - 2024

Education
======
* Ph.D in Biomedical Science, Uconn Health / University of Connecticut, 2023
* M.S. in Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2018
* B.S. in Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, 2015


Research Experience
======
- Modeling extra-embryonic mesenchymal cell (ExMC) lineages in the early embryonic development by human induced pluripotent stem cell
  - *Supervisor: Dr. Paul Robson, Aug 2019 - Nov 2023*
  - Generated a novel cell model for the ExMC lineage.
  - Revealed the key regulators for the ExMC commitment and differentiation.
  - Demonstrated the evolution and biological function of ExMC.


- Developing tools for multiplexed transcriptome engineering based on CRISPR RNA scaffold
  - *Supervisor: Dr. Albert Cheng & Dr. Paul Robson, Aug 2019 - Dec 2022*
  - Designed CREST architecture for multifunctional RNA editing and validated its capability on simultaneously induction of alternative splicing, A-to-G and C-to-U base editing.
  - Reconstituted split ADAR2 enzyme activity on desired transcript with CREST at high efficiency. 


- Dissecting side effect of transplanting cells from aged donor by single cell analysis
  - *Supervisor: Dr. Paul Robson & Dr. Ming Xu, Mar 2019 – Jan 2020*
  - Identified the senescent cell population in the human adipose cells from aged donor.
  - Described the side effects of transplanting senescent cells from aged donor to young mice.
  - Revealed the key singling pathways involved in the senescent cell.


- Investigating the function of RNA binding protein and miRNAs in tumorigenesis
  - *Supervisor: Dr. Haifan Lin, Oct 2016 – Jun 2018*
  - Revealed that PUMILIOs promote colorectal cancer growth and identified p21 transcript as the key target of PUMILIOs.
  - Demonstrated that miR221/2 promote TNBC progression by activating WNT signaling pathway.
